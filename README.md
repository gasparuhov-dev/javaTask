Unfortunately I was not able to make it run with th docker compose.

How to run:
1. Create and start local instance of rabbitMQ(docker container with rabbitMQ may also be used)
2. Navigate inside producer folder and execute following command: ./mvnw spring-boot:run
3. Navigate inside consumer folder and execute following command: ./mvnw spring-boot:run
